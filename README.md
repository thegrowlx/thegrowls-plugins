# xSuicide
Download at releases or https://github.com/thegrowlx/xSuicide/releases

This plugin is a very simple Spigot plugin and lets players commit suicide and kill other players with the command /kill

Commands | Permissions:
/kill | xsuicide.self
/kill <player> | xsuicide.others

This plugin is no longer in development as there is nothing else to add/change with it. 
It was originally just made as a plugin for my own server newfag.org becuase it needed a simple '/kill' command and I just made my own as I wanted some custom stuff in the code.
